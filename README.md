### Data source

The datasets I use for this dashboard is from [OECD Gender Data Portal](https://www.oecd.org/gender/), which includes selected indicators shedding light on gender inequalities in employment, development and governance, showing how far we are from achieving gender equality and where actions is most needed.  

The data covers OECD member countries, as well as partner economies including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa.  

For the dashboard, I extracted the data of employment, development and governance, and then compiled it into one file: **gender_ineq.RData**. 



## Purpose

#### A story-telling of gender inequality  

Even until this year 2019, gender inequality is still a huge main problem in the world. However, people are not aware of this problem or not convinced by the feminists, because of the fact that most of the arguments about gender inequality are not supported by data, which made the feminists argument vague and unconvincing.   
  
Hence, I would like to tell the whole story of gender inequality through this dashboard in various aspects: employment, development and governance.  
  
The goal is to give  people a clear understanding of the current situation of gender inequality happening all over the world.
